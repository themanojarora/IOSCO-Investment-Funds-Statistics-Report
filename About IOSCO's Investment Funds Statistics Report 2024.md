## About IOSCO's Investment Funds Statistics Report 2024

### 📘 Overview

This is the **third edition** of IOSCO's Investment Funds Statistics Report (IFSR), a global initiative to assess the leverage, liquidity, and counterparty risks in hedge funds (QHFs), open-ended funds (OEFs), and closed-ended funds (CEFs). Drawing from the submissions of 28 jurisdictions and covering \~80% of global fund NAV, the report aggregates insights from over USD 54.5 trillion in NAV.

---

### 📊 Survey Structure and Participation

* Fund Types Covered:

  * Qualified Hedge Funds (QHFs)
  * Open-Ended Funds (OEFs)
  * Closed-Ended Funds (CEFs)

* Jurisdiction Participation:

  * QHFs: 11 jurisdictions
  * OEFs: 22 jurisdictions
  * CEFs: 17 jurisdictions

Even with reduced participation from 2021 (e.g., fewer jurisdictions reporting QHF data), the effect on overall trends is minimal due to the relatively low NAV contribution of non-reporting jurisdictions.

### 🌍 Chapter 2: Data & Methodology

* **Data Collection**:

  * Voluntarily submitted by IOSCO members
  * Converted to USD using year-end 2022 exchange rates

* **Key Sources**:

  * US: Form PF and N-PORT
  * EU: AIFMD (UCITS only partially included)
  * Limitations in standardization across jurisdictions

* **Leverage Definitions**:

  * **Gross Leverage** = Total Market Exposure / NAV (via GNE)
  * **Synthetic Leverage** = Total Derivatives Exposure / NAV
  * **Financial Leverage** = Borrowings / NAV
  * Net exposure not used due to netting limitations

* **QHF Criteria**:

  * Managed by a regulated entity
  * Minimum USD 500M AUM
  * Excludes funds-of-funds or multi-manager funds

* **Special Notes**:

  * **US Form PF** data includes offshore funds registered with SEC
  * **UCITS data** is sparse; new harmonized EU reporting expected by \~2029
  * **SEC reforms in 2023** add further reporting for stress events and disclosure on preferential treatment

### 🧾 Chapter 6: Summary & Conclusion

A declining trend in total aggregate NAV was observed across all fund types. However, this decline persists even when adjusted for equivalent reporting bases (i.e., jurisdictions that submitted data in both 2021 and 2022), confirming that the drop is not just due to fewer submissions.

#### Key Takeaways by Fund Type:

* **QHFs**:

  * Gross leverage declined to **10.3x NAV**, though non-IR/FX leverage is rising.
  * Synthetic leverage down to **7.7x NAV**; liquidity adequacy appears strong under normal market conditions.
  * UK QHFs remain highly leveraged synthetically (\~60x), often using IR derivatives speculatively.

* **OEFs**:

  * Maintain large exposures in **listed equities** and **IR derivatives**.
  * Gross leverage increased to **2.0x NAV**, synthetic to **1.18x NAV**.
  * Counterparty risk remains low, most OTC derivatives are bilateral.

* **CEFs**:

  * Focused on **unlisted equities**, **real estate**, and **FX derivatives**.
  * Gross leverage at **1.11x NAV**, with minimal synthetic leverage (**0.08x NAV**).
  * High bilateral transaction levels; France has the most concentrated counterparty exposure.

Across all fund types, **financial leverage declined** significantly in 2022. Most OTC derivatives continue to be transacted bilaterally, which could expose markets to counterparty risk, although no jurisdiction shows systemic exposure. The report notes ongoing improvements in global reporting frameworks, which will enhance data quality and trend visibility in future editions【86†source】.
